# Bourbaki-HackMaths

## Problem Statement

Build an application that can automatically evaluate handwritten mathematical problems.
Eg. given an equation 2+3 = 5, it should be able to tell whether the answer is correct or not.

**Preferred tech stack:** *A mobile App that consumes Python REST APIs.*

**Minimum Requirements:** *Start with simple arithmetic operations on integers - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division. It should follow the BODMAS principle*

**Bonus Points:** *If more complex use cases can be handled such as working with fractions, decimals, exponents etc. Sky's the limit for allowing evaluation of complex calculations and mathematical expressions.*

## Objective

Our objective is to solve mathematical problems from both handwritten text images
and computer font text that ranges from elementary maths like solving BODMAS
Expressions,algebra, functional and trigonometric equations,inequalities,calculus(consisting of calculating derivatives,integrals and solving differential equations),binomial expansion(for any index) ,coordinate geometry and complex numbers.

# BOURBAKI

Bourbaki is a mathematical app that processes handwritten texts and solves them correctly to give the right answer.Bourbaki also provides a platform that connects students with freelancing tutors and helps the student solve their vexing doubts. And just like the works of Nicolas Bourbaki, this app also brings together several mathematical domains under one platform. Also, Bourbaki can be thought of as a pseudonym for our group as well.
